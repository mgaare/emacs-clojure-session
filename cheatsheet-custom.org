* Emacs keybinding cheatsheet

This cheatsheet includes some non-standard bindings that correspond
with my recommended tweaks. If you elected not to enable those tweaks,
then use the [standard key bindings cheat
sheet](./cheatsheet-standard.org).

** Basics

*** Files

| Key     | Action                    |
|---------+---------------------------|
| C-x C-f | "find file" - open a file |
| C-x C-s | save current buffer       |
| C-x C-a | "save as"                 |

Since we enabled Helm mode, we have a fancy-pants interface for "find
file" that includes these bindings:

| Key | Action                          |
|-----+---------------------------------|
| C-j | "jump" into directory           |
| C-l | go up one level                 |
| RET | open the file, or the directory |

*** Navigation

| Key     | Command                                   |

| C-b     | "back", eg left arrow for the lazy        |

| M->     | goto end of buffer                        |
